        All that time I wasted on you, you broke my heart and ran right away, all I wanted was for you to stay, I Didn't know you'd go that low, guess that's what was needed for me to grow


You told me I was worth your time, Even your mom was happy you had me, what you did to me should be a crime

All I saw was a future with you, guess you saw differently and were done playing with me


Don't know what I did to do deserve this, guess I was wrong and overthought, I lost you so quickly was it wrong that I had those feelings that I caught? Was this ever right or did you lose sight? Please just give me closure it's all I want


You told me I was worth your time, Even your mom was happy you had me, what you did to me should be a crime

All I saw was a future with you, guess you saw differently and were done playin with me.


Why wasn't I worth your time? Why wasn't I worth your time? What Did I do wrong? What did I do wrong?
